# New Relic integration for PostgreSQL

The New Relic integration for PostgreSQL captures critical performance metrics and inventory reported by PostgreSQL instances. Data on the level of instance, database, and collection is collected. Additionally, the integration can be configured to collect metrics on PgBouncer.

Inventory data for the configuration of the instance is collected from the `pg_statistics` database.

## Requirements

A user with the necessary permissions must be present on the database for all metrics to be collected.

## Installation and usage

For installation and usage instructions, see our [documentation web site](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/postgresql-monitoring-integration).

## Building

Golang is required to build the integration. We recommend Golang 1.11 or higher.

After cloning this repository, go to the directory of the PostgreSQL integration and build it:

```bash
$ make
```

The command above executes the tests for the PostgreSQL integration and builds an executable file called `nri-postgresql` under the `bin` directory.

To start the integration, run `nri-postgresql`:

```bash
$ ./bin/nri-postgresql
```

If you want to know more about usage of `./bin/nri-postgresql`, pass the `-help` parameter:

```bash
$ ./bin/nri-postgresql -help
```

External dependencies are managed through the [govendor tool](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor). Locking all external dependencies to a specific version (if possible) into the vendor directory is required.

## Testing

To run the tests execute:

```bash
$ make test
```
